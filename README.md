# Jobs Knock Doors

## Paradise of Jobs

Jobs Knock Doors is a job searching portal. A job seeker or an employer can create an account using email and password through custom authentication. There is a card for each job and by clicking on them, if job seekers are logged in, they go to the job detail page. Job Seekers can also edit their profile upon registration. Employers can post a job, search for job seekers and visit their profile. There is a job searching feature also.
